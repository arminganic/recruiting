# Welcome to the Recruiting Sample Project

This project is designed to assess your Kotlin skills by creating a system to manage a library's book collection. You'll work with existing data and code, enhancing type safety and fixing functionality.

## Project Overview

In this project, you will:

1. Enhance the type safety of the provided data.
2. Fix the `LibraryService` to ensure it works correctly with the given tests.

## What You'll Need to Do

### 1. Improve Type Safety

Currently, the data provided is not very type-safe, which can be frustrating, especially for new developers. Your first task is to enhance the type safety of this data. We've provided two files that define the types and their properties, but they lack property type definitions.

**Steps:**

- Locate the data files that need type safety improvements.
- Define the necessary properties in the provided type definition files to ensure data is type-safe.

### 2. Fix `LibraryService`

We've created a `LibraryService` to manage our library's books. However, it doesn't work as expected. Your second task is to debug and fix this service.

**Steps:**

- Review the existing `LibraryService` implementation.
- Identify and fix the issues causing it to malfunction.
- Run the provided tests to verify that the `LibraryService` works as expected.

## Conclusion

This project will help you demonstrate your ability to work with Kotlin, enhance type safety, and debug existing code. Good luck, and happy coding!
